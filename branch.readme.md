Branch to upgrade to laravel 7.

Currently waiting for 
https://github.com/HTMLMin/Laravel-HTMLMin/pull/148
to be merged.

Then composer update maybe works.

Following this guide to upgrade:
https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/upgrade

Todo:
- make composer upgrade work
- make cors work native (remove packages for that)
